Search for any location using the Foursquare API and get the top 6 results in the form of buttons. <br>
When you click on a button, a lightbox opens with more info on that location as well as a tip/review. <br>
The tip/review contains the location's Foursquare rating, a Cat GIF and a Ron Swanson quote. <br>
If you can't decide on a location to search, there are 3 preloaded "popular locations" you can choose. <br>
