## Kitty Opinions

Kitty Opinions was originally built as a [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com) Capstone Project but has since been revised several times. View the latest live site [here](https://ljyockey.github.io/kitty-opinions/).

### What is it?
Search for any location using the Foursquare API and get the top 6 results in the form of buttons. <br>
When you click on a button, a modal opens with more info on that location as well as a tip/review. <br>
The tip/review contains the location's Foursquare rating, a Cat GIF and a Ron Swanson quote. <br>
If you can't decide on a location to search, there are 3 preloaded "popular locations" you can choose. <br>


### How was it built?

**Languages**

This web app was built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No libaries. No plugins.

**APIs**
- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/)
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
- [Ron Swanson Quotes](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes#ron-swanson-quotes-api)

**Accessibility**

I will continue to make improvments to this app the more I learn about digital accessibility to ensure that everyone can enjoy it.
Recent improvments include switching to a more usable [modal](js/modal.js) and adding an [accordion](js/accordion.js).
